Machine learning is a branch in computer science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn.  Typical tasks are concept learning, function learning or “predictive modeling”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. These tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, for example.  The hope that comes with this discipline is that including the experience into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. But this improvement needs to happen in such a way that the learning itself becomes automatic so that humans like ourselves don’t need to interfere anymore is the ultimate goal.
